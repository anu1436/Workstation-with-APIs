# Workstation with APIs
 I have used 4 APIs to build a workstation setup

## Workstation Dashboard

# Introduction

Workstation Dashboard is a web application built to optimize your productivity by consolidating various APIs into a single user-friendly interface. It's designed to provide a seamless integration of Google Calendar, the World Clock API, YouTube API, and a dynamic background image service, creating an environment that fosters focus and efficiency.

# Features

1. Google Calendar Integration: Display your Google Calendar tasks as a checklist to keep track of your daily agenda.
2. World Clock API: Present the current time using a stylish digital clock that can be set to different time zones.
3. YouTube API: An embedded YouTube player curated to play lo-fi music that helps with relaxation and focus.
4. Dynamic Background: The background of the dashboard updates with high-quality images from Lorem Picsum, refreshing every 5 seconds to keep your workspace vibrant and dynamic.
Prerequisites

To run the Workstation Dashboard, ensure you have:
A Windows, Linux, or Mac machine.
The latest version of Python and pip installed.
Basic knowledge of Python and Flask.
